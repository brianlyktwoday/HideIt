**The "now you see me, now you don't" package for Umbraco Block List and Block Grid!**


Ever wanted to temporarily hide a block without deleting it? Maybe it's a seasonal promo, a work-in-progress section, or that testimonial from your ex-client. Whatever the reason - Hide It has your back.

Works with both **Block List** and **Block Grid** editors.

## What's in the Box?

- **One-Click Toggle** — Eye icon right there in the block action bar. Click it. Done.
- **Visual Feedback** — Hidden blocks get dimmed so you know what's hiding
- **Zero View Changes** — Hidden blocks vanish from the frontend *automagically*
- **Search-Safe Content** — Hidden block content is excluded from Umbraco search indexing
- **Nested Support** — BlockGrid areas? Yep, filters all the way down

## Installation

```bash
dotnet add package Our.Umbraco.HideIt
```

## Setup (It's Stupid Simple)

1. Add a **True/False** property to your block's **Settings** element type
2. Give it the alias `hideIt`
3. There is no step 3

The toggle appears. The magic happens. Your frontend stays clean.

## How It Works

### On the Frontend
Nothing! That's the point. Hidden blocks just... aren't there. The package intercepts Umbraco's property converters and filters them out before your views even see them.

## Requirements

- Umbraco **17.5+** _(that's when [block actions](https://releases.umbraco.com/release/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/17.5.0) became a thing)_ or **18.x**
- .NET 10.0

## Versions

| Package Version | Umbraco Version |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| 18.x            | 18.0.0 - 18.x   |
| 17.x            | 17.5.0 - 17.x   |

## Advanced / Extensibility

### Custom Alias

Maybe `hideIt` isn't your style, or you're migrating a site that already has its own "hide this" property. Point Hide It at any alias in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "HideIt": {
    "PropertyAlias": "hideFromSite"
  }
}
```

Both the backoffice toggle and the frontend filtering pick up the custom alias. Leave the setting out and the default `hideIt` keeps working.

### Want Full Control of Block Styling?

Set `HideIt:CssPath` to your own stylesheet path in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "HideIt": {
    "CssPath": "/css/hideit-custom.css"
  }
}
```

- If `CssPath` is **not set**, Hide It keeps the current default dimmed styling for hidden blocks.
- If `CssPath` **is set**, Hide It skips its default styling and loads your stylesheet instead (including inside block-entry shadow roots).

Hide It adds these state markers on each block entry:

- Hidden state: `data-hideit-hidden` attribute + `.hideit-block--hidden` class
- Visible state: `.hideit-block--visible` class

Use those selectors in your CSS to style hidden/visible blocks exactly how you want.

### Custom Action Icons

You can override the action icon for both states in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "HideIt": {
    "VisibleIcon": "/icons/power.svg",
    "HiddenIcon": "/icons/power-off.svg"
  }
}
```

- `VisibleIcon` controls the icon shown when the block is currently visible.
- `HiddenIcon` controls the icon shown when the block is currently hidden.
- Values must be SVG paths (for example `/icons/power.svg`).

### Manual Filtering

Don't trust the magic? Fair. Extension methods are available:

```csharp
using HideIt;

// Filter manually
var visibleBlocks = Model.Blocks.WhereVisible();
var visibleGrid = Model.Grid.WhereVisible();

// Check a single block
if (!block.IsBlockHidden())
{
    // This block is ready for its close-up
}
```

### Custom Block Conversion Pipeline

If you previously replaced `BlockListPropertyValueConverter` or `BlockGridPropertyValueConverter`, switch to Hide It's filter extension points instead:

```csharp
using HideIt;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Models.Blocks;

public class MyCustomBlockListFilter : IHideItBlockListFilter {
    public BlockListModel Filter(BlockListModel model) {
        // Your custom filtering/transformation
        return model;
    }
}

public class MyCustomBlockGridFilter : IHideItBlockGridFilter {
    public BlockGridModel Filter(BlockGridModel model) {
        // Your custom filtering/transformation
        return model;
    }
}

builder.Services.AddSingleton<IHideItBlockListFilter, MyCustomBlockListFilter>();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IHideItBlockGridFilter, MyCustomBlockGridFilter>();
```

This keeps Hide It's built-in hide logic and your custom logic in the same pipeline without chained converter `Replace<>()` calls.

## Contributing

### Local Umbraco test site

An in-repo Umbraco 18 site is available under `HideIt.Test`.

- Open `HideIt.slnx`
- Start `HideIt.Test` with **IIS Express** or the **Umbraco.Web.UI** profile
- The site uses the local `HideIt.csproj` via project reference, so backoffice/frontend changes are picked up automatically
- The sample is intentionally a single-page homepage test surface focused on **Content Rows** (Block List) and **Content Grid** (Block Grid)
- The sample ships with a seeded SQLite database, so you can start testing immediately
- Backoffice login: `admin@example.com` / `1234567890`
